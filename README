A simple shell script to manage backups of a VMware server
in two stages;

1. A mirror of VM folders, and host filesystems with daily tarballs

2. A copy of latest daily tarballs to remote/removable media

Manifest:
    README                      - this file
    vmwbackup.sh                - controlling script, called from cron etc
    vmbackup-functions.sh       - supporting functions
    vmbackuprc-example          - local configuration (copy to .vmbackuprc)

Installation:

    Copy vmbackup{,-backup}.sh and your .vmbackuprc (see example) to a
    destination folder, and run vmbackup.sh from that folder (ie cd
    set to destination folder)

Configuration:

    Configurable variables are commented in vmbackuprc-example. There
    are settings for backup volumes, removable media volumes,
    purge-times, reporting mail-address etc. There are also hooks for
    injecting script at the start and end of vmbackup.sh proper
    ... for example to spin-up/spin-down USB disks.
